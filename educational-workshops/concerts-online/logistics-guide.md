# Logistics guide for Concerts Online, an interactive impact mapping workshop

This guide explains how to set up the facilities for the workshop. If you're working with a third-party conference organiser or educational provider, send them this upfront so 
they can arrange everything the way you need.

## Facilities


This workshop requires the following facilities:

* A projector and suitable wall or screen for projection, clearly visible to all the participants
* A whiteboard or a flipchart for the facilitator, clearly visible to all the participants
* A table for the facilitator's computer with a power outlet close by, with a standard VGA socket. If at all possible, avoid running the workshop by uploading slides to the facilities computers. 
* Cabaret-style seating for groups. Classroom seating is also OK as long as the participants can move chairs and tables around and form small groups. Theatre style seating with fixed chairs in rows is not OK for this training.
* Sufficient space between the tables so that people can move around the room without disrupting the groups working on the tables (eg at least one meter between the chairs on either end while people are seated around the tables)
* Ideally easily accessible flat walls where the participants can put up sticky notes/flipcharts. Rooms with decorative walls, rough textures, paintings, round pillars and should be avoided if possible, because they tend to look good but prevent good facilitation.

The participants will work in groups of 4-5. Each group will need: 

* One table able to sit all group members and allow them to write on paper. Tables should ideally be apart enough so that the groups can work separately. Tables that host more than one group should be avoided. 
* One whiteboard or a flip-chart, or if that is not possible, an area of a wall where the groups can put paper to write on. In the latter case, the workshop also requires a roll of whiteboard static film (eg [Magic Whiteboard](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Magic-Whiteboard-G450/dp/B001P5UAV8) or [Sticky flip-charts](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Post-Command-58-4x50-8-Self-Stick/dp/B0000E2RGR))
* A block of 100 of large (76 mm x 127 mm or larger) sticky notes, ideally of different colours.
* A set of whiteboard markers of various colours.
* Pens and notepads for each participant to write on

The participants will not use computers during this workshop. Ideally, the tables should not have computers on them. If the workshop facilities have fixed computers that cannot be removed for the duration of the workshop, at least ensure that monitors do not obstruct the view and that the participants have sufficient space on tables to write on paper and collaborate.

## Printed materials

The following materials should be printed, one for each participant

* [Impact Mapping Cheat Sheat](handouts/cheatsheet.doc)
* (Optional) [The Impact Mapping Poster](handouts/poster-35x23inch.pdf) This is a huge poster â€“ print size is 23 inch x 35 inch (can also be A1 format). Please ensure that it is printed in right size and full colour, and do not print small A4/A5 copies or anything like that, it's better not to have small versions at all.  If you print the poster, then please provide rubber bands or something else for participants to fold posters with when they take them home 
* (Optional) [The Impact Mapping Book](https://www.impactmapping.org/book.html)
